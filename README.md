# HW 0 - Setup

## Purpose

This homework allows you to verify that you have the latest Python version installed within a virtual environment.

## Homework Deliverable

For this homework, do the following:

1. Create a virtual environment on your computer using any method of your choice: [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html), etc.
2. Once you have created the virtual environment, activate it and ensure your coding environment, e.g., PyCharm or any other IDE, is set up to operate within the virtual environment.
3. Run the supplied `main.py` file, which will then output a `setup_config.txt` file that reports which Python version you have installed, whether it's installed within a virtual environment or not, and the name and the path of the virtual environment. The same report will also print to your terminal.
4. If the aforementioned report says your Python isn't installed within a virtual environment, troubleshoot your setup to ensure the name and the path of your virtual environment is reported.
5. Push your repo to GitHub. Notice that there was no coding necessary, which means the only update to your repo will be the report file.
